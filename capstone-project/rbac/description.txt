PROJECT TITLE:Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System 

1. OVERVIEW
- Built a complete RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- Implements Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles with distinct permissions.
- Uses JWT authentication and middleware-based authorization.
- Enforces data scoping and row-level ownership.
- UI adapts dynamically based on user role and permissions.

2. ROLES AND PERMISSIONS
Admin:
- Can create, read, update, and delete all posts.
- Can manage all users and assign roles.

Editor:
- Can create, read, update, and delete only their own posts.
- Cannot manage users or other editors’ content.

Viewer:
- Can only read posts.
- Cannot create, update, or delete any data.

3. BACKEND FEATURES
- Authentication: JWT-based login and verification.
- Authorization: Middleware checks for allowed roles.
- Ownership: Editors can modify or delete only their posts.
- Data Scoping: Editors see their posts; Admin sees all.
- Protected Routes:
  /auth/login – User authentication
  /auth/me – Verify token and return role info
  /posts – CRUD operations with role checks
  /admin/users – Admin can list and change user roles
- Error Handling: 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found)

4. FRONTEND FEATURES
- Login Page: User authentication using email and password.
- Dashboard: Displays posts and role-specific actions.
- UI Guarding: Buttons and routes hidden based on permissions.
- Dynamic Permissions:
  Admin – Full CRUD access
  Editor – Own posts only
  Viewer – Read-only access
- Color Palette Used:
  #2b6777, #c8d8e4, #ffffff, #f2f2f2, #52ab98

5. API TESTING (POSTMAN)
- POST /auth/login → Returns JWT token.
- GET /auth/me → Verifies token and shows role info.
- GET /posts → Lists posts (Editor sees only own).
- POST /posts → Create post (Admin/Editor only).
- PUT /posts/:id → Update post (Admin or own post).
- DELETE /posts/:id → Delete post (Admin or own post).
- Invalid token → 401 Unauthorized.
- Forbidden action → 403 Forbidden.

6. SEEDED USERS
Admin User:
  Email: admin@test.com
  Password: password123

Editor User:
  Email: editor@test.com
  Password: password123

Viewer User:
  Email: viewer@test.com
  Password: password123

7. SECURITY & VALIDATION
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt.
- Token expiry set to 1 hour.
- Input validation using Joi.
- CORS and CSRF considerations.
- Deny-by-default authorization policy.

8. TECH STACK
Frontend: React.js, Axios, Context API
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT, Joi
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose 
Testing Tool: Postman

9. PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
- Secure role-based access and ownership checks.
- Full CRUD operations with role enforcement.
- Token-based authentication with permission validation.
- Dynamic UI adapting to user roles.
- Clean color scheme and responsive design.
