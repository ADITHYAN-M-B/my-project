In this experiment, I developed a simple Admin Dashboard web page using semantic HTML and CSS.
The structure of the dashboard is defined in the base.html file, where semantic tags such as <header>,
<aside>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> are used to organize the content meaningfully.
The header contains the dashboard title and a dark mode toggle, while the sidebar navigation is
implemented with the <aside> and <nav> tags, providing links to different sections like Home, Users, and Settings.
The main area displays a welcome message and serves as the primary space for dashboard content,
and the footer is placed at the bottom, centered for visual balance.
Styling is handled in the style.css file, which uses CSS techniques like flexbox to create a responsive layout.
The header and footer are highlighted with a green background and white text, while the sidebar features
a light background and styled navigation links.
The main content area is kept clean and readable. Flexbox is used to align the sidebar and main content
horizontally, and the footer is centered both vertically and horizontally.
This experiment demonstrates the use of semantic HTML for better accessibility and maintainability, combined 
with CSS for layout and design.
The result is a visually organized and user-friendly admin dashboard interface, with a dark mode option to enhance
