E-Commerce Product API:

Create a Node.js backend API to manage products in an e-commerce platform. Users can view, add, update, or delete products.

- Products are stored in MongoDB with fields: name, price, description, category, stock, createdAt.
- Validation ensures required fields are provided and price is non-negative.
- Categories include Electronics, Clothing, Books, Home, Other.
- CRUD operations allow safe management of product data.

API Endpoints:
1. GET /products → View all products.
2. GET /products/:id → View a specific product.
3. POST /products/add → Add a new product. Body: { name, price, description, category, stock }
4. PUT /products/:id → Update a product. Body: { name, price, description, category, stock }
5. DELETE /products/:id → Delete a product.

Testing with Postman:
- Start server:
  node server.js
- Set environment variable: baseUrl = http://localhost:3000
- Steps:
  1. GET /products → Check all products.
  2. POST /products/add → Add a product.
  3. PUT /products/:id → Update a product.
  4. GET /products/:id → Verify changes.
  5. DELETE /products/:id → Remove a product.

Observations:
- All CRUD operations work as expected.
- Validation prevents incorrect product data.
- Easy to extend with user authentication, order management, or reviews.
