Experiment: Implementing Protected Routes with JWT Verification

1. Set up a Node.js and Express.js backend server.

2. Implement a login route that authenticates a user using predefined credentials.

3. Generate a JWT token upon successful login.

4. Create a middleware function to verify JWT tokens from the Authorization header.

5. Apply the middleware to protect specific routes so only users with valid tokens can access them.

6. Test the protected routes using Postman:
   - Access with a valid token → request succeeds.
   - Access with an invalid or missing token → request is blocked.
   
7. Observe how JWT authentication restricts access and ensures route security.
