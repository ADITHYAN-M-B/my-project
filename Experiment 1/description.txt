CSS STYLING BREAKDOWN

1. ELEMENT: form (Main Form Container)
Purpose: Styles the form background to make it stand out from the page background.
- background-color: grey; → Applies a solid grey background color to the form.

(Note: Your current CSS only styles the form background. Further enhancements like padding, margin, border-radius, and font styling could improve readability.)
