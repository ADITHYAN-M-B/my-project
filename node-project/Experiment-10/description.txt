CLI Employee Management System Using Node.js and Arrays

Code Explanation:

1. Importing readline module:
   - The code uses Node.js's built-in 'readline' module to handle user input from the terminal.
   - This allows interactive input/output without any GUI.

2. Employee Array:
   - An empty array 'employees' is created to store employee objects.
   - Each employee object has two properties: 'id' and 'name'.

3. Readline Interface:
   - The 'readline.createInterface' function sets up input and output streams for the terminal.
   - 'input' is set to process.stdin and 'output' to process.stdout.

4. showMenu() Function:
   - Displays a text-based menu to the user with four options:
     1. Add Employee
     2. List Employees
     3. Remove Employee
     4. Exit
   - Prompts the user to choose an option.

5. handleMenu(option) Function:
   - Takes the user's input and decides which action to perform.
   - Calls 'addEmployee()', 'listEmployees()', 'removeEmployee()', or closes the program.

6. addEmployee() Function:
   - Prompts the user to enter an employee ID and name.
   - Checks if the ID already exists in the array to avoid duplicates.
   - Adds a new employee object to the array if the ID is unique.
   - Confirms addition to the user and returns to the menu.

7. listEmployees() Function:
   - Checks if there are employees in the array.
   - If the array is empty, it shows 'No employees found.'
   - Otherwise, it loops through the array and prints each employee's ID and name.

8. removeEmployee() Function:
   - Prompts the user to enter the ID of the employee to remove.
   - Searches the array for the employee with the given ID.
   - If found, removes the employee using 'splice' and confirms deletion.
   - If not found, displays an error message.
   - Returns to the menu afterward.

9. Starting the Application:
   - The 'showMenu()' function is called at the end to start the interactive CLI.
   - The program runs in a loop until the user selects the 'Exit' option.

Summary:
This code demonstrates:
- Creating an interactive CLI in Node.js.
- Handling user input using 'readline'.
- Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete) on an array.
- Ensuring uniqueness of employee IDs.
- Looping the menu until the user decides to exit.
