This experiment is a simple responsive banking user interface built using only HTML and CSS.  
The HTML file defines the structure of the interface. It contains an outer container (outer_box)
which centers the UI on the page and an inner container (inner_box) which holds the main content.
Inside the inner_box, there is a heading element (h1) used to display the balance amount, which 
is currently set to $0. Below the balance, there is a container (buttons) that holds two buttons:
a green Deposit button and a red Withdraw button.The CSS file is responsible for styling and making
the design responsive. The body of the page uses Flexbox to center the entire UI vertically and 
horizontally within the viewport. The outer_box and inner_box are styled with padding, rounded corners, 
and box shadows to give a clean card-like appearance.The buttons are styled to be full-width by default
with proper spacing between them. The Deposit button is green while the Withdraw button is red, and
both buttons have hover effects that slightly darken theircolors for better user feedback. To make the
UI responsive, a media query is used for screen sizes 480px and smaller. At this size, the layout of 
the buttons changes from a vertical stack to a horizontalarrangement using Flexbox. The buttons adjust
to share equal width when side by side, ensuring thedesign works well on mobile devices.
