JWT Authentication for Secure Banking API Endpoints

Objective: Learn to implement JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints.

  - Create a /login route with hardcoded username and password.
  - Generate and return a JWT token upon successful login.
  - Implement middleware to verify JWT token for protected banking routes.
  - Create protected routes: /balance, /deposit, /withdraw.
  - Handle errors like invalid tokens or insufficient balance.
  - Test the API by logging in, obtaining a token, and accessing protected routes.

Learning Outcome: Secure API design using JWT, understanding token verification and controlled access.
