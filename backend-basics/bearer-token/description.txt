Middleware Implementation for Logging and Bearer Token Authentication

Objective: Learn to implement middleware in Express.js for logging requests and protecting routes.

  - Create a logging middleware that records HTTP method, URL, and timestamp for each request.
  - Create an authentication middleware that allows access only with the Bearer token "mysecrettoken".
  - Apply logging middleware globally and authentication middleware to protected routes.
  - Create at least two routes:
    - Public route (no authentication required)
    - Protected route (requires Bearer token)
  - Test using Postman or curl to verify logging and authentication.

Learning Outcome: Understanding middleware implementation and secure route access in Node.js.
